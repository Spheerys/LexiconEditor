# LexiconEditor

Manage your MODX sites translations

## Features

The Lexicon-Editor provides a Custom-Manager-Page for editors to manage the translations of their site. The Grid is limited to a single namespace. That way you can allow editors to translate the lexicon of the site without touching any other areas of the MODX Lexicon.

The extra will backup all files and folders inside your MODX installation and
will also include the core-folder if placed outside the web-root.

Just select the Namespace in the System-Settings you would like to provide the editors to manage.
